# Server-Sent-Events (SSE) support
Eventhub supports [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) protocol for subscriptions. You will still have to use websockets/one of the official libraries for publishing messages.
In the future we might add a REST-api for publishing to bypass this requirement.

Using SSE has some disadvantages compared to Websocket because of it's protocol limitations. The biggest one being that you can only subscribe to one topic/pattern per sse-connection. Also if subscribing to a pattern you will not see what part of that pattern that actually matched in your reponse, so if this is important for your app you need to include it as part of your message/payload.

You need to configure Eventhub to enable SSE in your configuration as this is disabled per default. This is done by setting the ```enable_sse``` setting to true.

## How to subscribe using SSE
Eventhub determines wether a client wants to use SSE protocol by looking at the ```Accept``` header. If this is set to ```text/event-stream``` we initiate the client using SSE-protocol rather than Websockets. All SSE client implementations should set this header for you automatically.

The subscription topic/path is specified using the request URI. Note that you need to url-encode special characters, so # becomes %23 and + becomes %2B.
Auth token is specified either using the ```auth``` query parameter or by setting the ```Authorization``` header.

Example request using Curl:
```
# Subscribe to topic1/#.
curl -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' 'http://eventhub.local/topic1/%23?auth=<my-jwt-token>'
```

Example response:
```
:ok                    // Connection OK

id: 1640088887266-0   // Message ID
data: Foobar          // Message content

:                     // Ping event.
```
